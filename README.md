# Adding Frenzy
## Adding Frenzy Contest

Rules are simple. There is a test which tests function. Function has to add two numbers and return result. Make test pass.
But make it pass in most obscure, crazy and creative way you can.

## Installation guide

Clone repository.

Make virtualenv `python3 -m venv ~/adding_frenzy`, and activate it.

Install requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Testing guide

Just `make test`.

## Whats next?

Fork it, add code to `adding_frenzy.py`, show it to me and to the world!


## Example implementation

Based on binary counter and hand made binary to integer conversion :) Nothing fancy but does the job.
